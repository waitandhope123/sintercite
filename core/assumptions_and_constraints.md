# Assumptions and Constraints

This document outlines the physical, chemical, and environmental assumptions underlying the **Sintercite Hypothesis**, as well as the constraints that define where and how Sintercites can plausibly arise. These boundaries ensure that the model remains scientifically grounded while allowing speculative exploration.

## 1. Cosmic Material Abundance

### Assumptions
- Silicates (SiO₂, SiC, aluminosilicates) are among the most abundant solid materials in the universe.
- Iron, nickel, and carbon are widely available in asteroid regolith.
- Fine-grain dust suitable for sintering is naturally produced by micrometeorite impacts and space weathering.

### Constraints
- Sintercites must form from **common cosmic materials**; no rare or exotic elements are assumed.
- Construction must rely on **naturally occurring mineral processes**, not engineered components.

---

## 2. Energy Sources

### Assumptions
- Airless bodies experience intense thermal cycling due to direct solar heating and deep nocturnal cooling.
- Thermal gradients are sufficient to:
  - Sinter loose mineral particles
  - Induce expansion/contraction stress
  - Cause mechanical fracturing at predictable boundaries

### Constraints
- Sintercites cannot form in environments without **thermal cycling**.
- They require **vacuum or low-pressure conditions** to allow effective sintering.

---

## 3. Environmental Conditions

### Assumptions
- Asteroid surfaces provide stable long-term environments with:
  - Continuous solar exposure
  - Large temperature swings
  - Minimal atmospheric interference
  - Abundant loose regolith

### Constraints
- Sintercites are unlikely to form in:
  - High-pressure atmospheres
  - Liquid-dominated environments
  - Highly geologically active bodies
- They require **surface stability over long timescales** for evolution to occur.

## 4. Structural and Material Behavior

### Assumptions
- Silicate materials can fuse (sinter) under solar heating.
- Metal grains or carbon inclusions can form conductive or compositional patterns within a silicate matrix.
- Physical patterns can bias where sintering occurs, enabling a form of structural “inheritance.”

### Constraints
- No complex electronics, computation, or mobility exist at protocell stages.
- Information must be encoded **geometrically or materially**, not digitally.

---

## 5. Replication Feasibility

### Assumptions
- Mechanical stresses during cooling can produce fractures that divide a structure into smaller fragments.
- These fragments may retain internal patterns that influence future growth.

### Constraints
- Replication is **entirely passive**, driven by environmental energy.
- Generation times are long (years to centuries), depending on thermal cycles.

---

## 6. Evolutionary Requirements

### Assumptions
- Replication produces variation due to:
  - Imperfect sintering
  - Irregular dust accumulation
  - Microfractures
  - Environmental noise
- Variants with more favorable geometries or heat distribution replicate more efficiently.

### Constraints
- Evolution proceeds through **structural and material optimization**, not biological mutation.
- Selection acts on *replication success* based solely on physical durability and geometry.

## Summary

The Sintercite Hypothesis assumes only:
- Common cosmic materials  
- Standard thermodynamic processes  
- Realistic regolith behavior  
- Passive environmental energy inputs  

No advanced engineering, biological chemistry, or exotic physics are required.

These assumptions and constraints establish the realistic foundation for the existence and evolution of **Sintercites**.
