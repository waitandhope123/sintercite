# Replication Cycle

This document describes the replication process of a Sintercite, which operates through a passive two-phase cycle driven entirely by environmental energy. Replication relies on the interaction between solar heating, material sintering, thermal stress, and fracture mechanics.

The cycle consists of:

1. **Growth Phase (Sintering)**
2. **Division Phase (Thermal Fracture)**

Together, these phases enable a minimal form of non-organic reproduction.

## 1. Growth Phase: Sintering

During daylight, direct solar radiation heats the exposed surface of a Sintercite. Temperatures may rise to several hundred degrees Celsius, high enough to:

- Partially melt or soften silicate dust  
- Fuse loose particles onto the protocell’s body  
- Strengthen existing structural patterns  
- Build new layers of material over time  

### **Accretion Process**
Loose regolith particles accumulate preferentially along:

- Raised ridges  
- Conductive inclusions  
- Material discontinuities  

These features absorb heat differently, guiding where sintering is most effective.

### **Pattern Reinforcement**
Metallic or carbon-based inclusions form localized heating or conductivity differences, creating:

- Self-amplifying structural pathways  
- Areas where material fuses more readily  
- A form of “geometric inheritance”  

Over many cycles, patterns deepen and refine.

## 2. Transition: Thermal Stress Accumulation

As the Sintercite cools after sunset:

- The outer shell contracts rapidly  
- The inner mass cools more slowly  
- Mechanical stress builds along zones of weakness  

These stresses accumulate over thousands of cycles.

The result is a predictable set of fracture lines, often guided by:

- Existing inclusions  
- Grain boundaries  
- Prior microcracks  
- Structural asymmetries

## 3. Division Phase: Fracturing

Once internal stress exceeds material strength, the Sintercite undergoes **brittle fracture**, splitting into two or more fragments.

Each daughter fragment:

- Retains part of the parent’s pattern  
- Contains conductive inclusions  
- Possesses its own surface-ready regolith for further sintering  

This satisfies the core requirement for **replication with inheritance**.

### **Fragment Viability**
Not all fragments are equally viable. Those that:

- Have good access to solar heating  
- Maintain stable structural patterns  
- Possess conductive inclusions  

…are more likely to continue the replication cycle.

This introduces **natural selection** into the process.

## 4. Variation and Mutation

Variation arises naturally from:

- Irregular accretion of dust  
- Uneven heating  
- Microfractures during cooling  
- Noise in material deposition  
- Random orientation after fragmentation  

Some variants replicate more efficiently, leading to:

- Pattern evolution  
- Shape optimization  
- Improved fracture predictability  

Over long timescales, this supports **non-organic evolution**.

## 5. Replication Timescales

Sintercite replication is slow compared to biological systems. Estimated timescales:

- **Accretion:** years to decades  
- **Pattern reinforcement:** decades to centuries  
- **Fracture and division:** occasional over long intervals  

Evolution occurs across geological timescales but remains plausible in stable asteroid environments.

## Summary

The Sintercite replication cycle is a passive, environmentally driven process:

1. **Sintering builds new layers and reinforces patterns**  
2. **Thermal stress creates fractures**  
3. **Fragments inherit structural information**  
4. **Variation allows selection to act**  

This cycle forms the basis for a plausible mechanism of **mineral-based machine abiogenesis**.
