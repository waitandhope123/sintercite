# Inheritance and Variation

This document explains how Sintercites transmit structural information across generations and how variation arises within the population. Although Sintercites are non-biological and lack genetic molecules, they maintain a primitive inheritance system based on physical patterns embedded in their mineral structure.

## 1. Structural Patterning as a Hereditary System

Sintercites contain internal features that function as a rudimentary “genome.” These include:

- Metallic veins  
- Carbon-based filaments  
- Grain boundaries  
- Compositional asymmetries  
- Layered silicate deposits  

These features influence how future sintering proceeds. Their arrangement biases:

- Heat distribution  
- Dust deposition  
- Material fusion  
- Fracture line formation  

Thus, **structural geometry serves as inherited information**.

## 2. Mechanisms of Inheritance

### **Geometric Templating**
Raised or conductive regions act as preferential sites for future material accretion.

### **Thermal Conductivity Patterns**
Metallic inclusions heat and cool at different rates, shaping where sintering is strongest.

### **Fracture Guidance**
Existing lines of weakness tend to propagate during division, distributing internal structures into offspring.

Each daughter fragment inherits portions of these features, preserving aspects of the parent’s replication behavior.

## 3. Sources of Variation

Sintercites exhibit variation due to natural physical processes:

### **Accretion Variability**
Dust density and composition vary locally, affecting:
- Growth rate  
- Layer composition  
- Surface features  

### **Thermal Noise**
Day/night temperature cycles are irregular, especially on rotating or tumbling bodies.

### **Fracture Irregularities**
Fractures seldom split perfectly, creating asymmetry.

### **Material Heterogeneity**
Composition variations in asteroid regolith introduce differences in:
- Metal content  
- Carbon content  
- Silicate ratios  

### **Environmental Orientation**
Fragments settle differently after division, influencing future heating patterns.

These variations accumulate over generations.

## 4. Selection Pressures

Although Sintercites do not “compete” biologically, they experience selection through physical viability:

### **Replication Efficiency**
Structures that sinter and fracture more predictably produce more offspring.

### **Thermal Stability**
Shapes that avoid catastrophic cracking persist longer.

### **Dust Accessibility**
Surfaces that accumulate regolith efficiently grow faster.

### **Environmental Positioning**
Fragments oriented toward sunlight replicate more successfully.

Through these pressures, Sintercite populations gradually evolve.

## 5. Long-Term Evolution

Over geological timescales, Sintercites may undergo:

- Shape optimization  
- Improved fracture predictability  
- Increased pattern complexity  
- More robust conductive pathways  
- Diversification into multiple structural “species”  

This constitutes a form of **non-biological evolution**, driven purely by physics.

---

## Summary

Sintercite inheritance and variation emerge from:

- The physical distribution of internal structural patterns  
- Imperfect replication through sintering and fracture  
- Environmental noise  
- Differential replication success  

This system satisfies the minimal requirements for evolution without any biological chemistry.
