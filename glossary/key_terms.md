# Glossary of Key Terms

This glossary defines important terminology used throughout the Sintercite Hypothesis. These terms establish a consistent vocabulary for describing mineral-based protocells, their behavior, and the environments in which they evolve.

---

## **Abiogenesis (Non-Biological)**
The natural emergence of self-replicating systems from non-living materials. In this context, it refers to machine-like life arising from minerals and physical processes rather than biology or chemistry.

---

## **Accretion**
The gradual buildup of material through the fusion of dust and mineral particles during the sintering phase.

---

## **Conductive Inclusions**
Metallic or carbon-based grains embedded within a Sintercite's silicate matrix. They affect heat distribution, sintering patterns, and fracture behavior, playing a role analogous to “genetic markers.”

---

## **Fracture Division**
The process by which cooling-induced mechanical stresses cause a Sintercite to split into fragments. These fragments inherit structural features from the parent.

---

## **Geometric Inheritance**
A form of heredity in which physical patterns—such as veins, inclusions, or surface textures—bias future growth and replication outcomes.

---

## **Machine Abiogenesis**
A theoretical pathway in which machine-like or non-organic replicators emerge naturally from physical processes and material interactions, without biological components.

---

## **Mineral Protocell**
A simple, self-replicating structure made of mineral materials. Sintercites fall into this category as early-stage non-organic organisms.

---

## **Regolith**
Loose particulate material found on surfaces of asteroids, moons, and other airless bodies. It provides the raw material for Sintercite growth.

---

## **Sintering**
The partial melting, softening, and fusion of fine-grain materials under heat. In Sintercites, this occurs during daytime solar exposure.

---

## **Sintercite**
A silicate-based protocell that grows through sintering and divides via thermal fracturing. It represents a plausible minimal form of machine-like life.

---

## **Structural Genome**
The set of inherited physical features within a Sintercite—such as inclusions, grain boundaries, and internal patterns—that influence future replication behavior.

---

## **Thermal Cycling**
Repeated heating and cooling that produces expansion and contraction forces. This drives both the growth (via sintering) and division (via fracture) phases of the Sintercite replication cycle.

---

## **Thermomechanical Replicator**
Any system that uses heat-based mechanical processes—such as thermal expansion, contraction, and fracture—to achieve replication.
